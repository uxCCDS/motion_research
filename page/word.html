		<p class='p'>As the barkeep at your neighborhood pub shouts after last call: “You don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here!”
Your friends who broadcast CEC are enjoying the Annual Shutdown, along with the rest of the company.<br>
It’s nice that you dropped by, perhaps to peruse some of our award-winning content or check our stock price.
However, CEC will remain in a state of cyber-hibernation until everyone returns on Wednesday, January 2.
After you soak in the soothing retro synth smash hit, a.k.a. Opus No. 1, kindly return to basking in the holiday spirit.
That’s right — close your laptop. Eat a cookie. Binge on Netflix. Power down to power up.</p>
